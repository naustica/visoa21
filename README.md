This website offers a comprehensive overview of Open Access implementation at publicly funded Universities of Applied Sciences and the Arts in Germany.

### Starting point

During the Summer School “Visualizing Open Access”, we were provided with the current research status of the Bundesländer-Atlas Open Access 2021. While knowledge on the situation of Open Access implementation at universities (Universitäten) is commonly in focus and widely research, little is known about Open Access at Universites of Applied Scienes and the Arts (Hochschulen). Our research question: What is the situation of Open Access at Hochschulen in Germany? 

### Data collection and Curation

We filtered Hochschulen and generated a list of 222. Additional data on the institutions (private, public, church-owned) allowed us to filter for a final list of 190 publicly Hochschulen (as of 2021). This additional data was provided by research of the summer school organizers. 

Institutions implement Open Access based on a list of criteria. On our website, you can filter these criteria and see the percentage of Hochschulen which have implemented them on a map of Germany. 

| Criteria              | Description                                                                                                                   |

### Design process

The visual storytelling was inspired by the word *filter* and the interaction of *filtering*. When playing with the idea, we found out that the infotainment approach was perceived as positive and low-threshold. We further elaborated this idea by choosing icons and colors close to the coffee world.

### Conclusion 

We gathered information about Open Access implementation at all publicly funded Universites of Applied Scienes and the Arts (Hochschulen) in Germany (as of 2021). This has not been done to this extend and allows new insights into the landscape of Open Access implementation beyond the perspective on universities. Our research provides new data on the status of Open Access implementation at institutions which have not participated in the Excellence Initiative competition for universities / German government’s Excellence Strategy (since 2019). Our research therefore adds to a more differentiated depiction of research done open access in Germany.
